gst-rpicamsrc is a GStreamer wrapper around the raspivid/raspistill
functionality of the RaspberryPi, providing a GStreamer
source element capturing from the Rpi camera.

To use it, you need GStreamer 1.0. As of the last time this README
was updated, Raspbian Jessie has GStreamer 1.4.4, which is recent enough.

Install the GStreamer 1.0 dev packages, then just build and install this module.

apt-get install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config libgstreamer1.0-dev \
 libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libraspberrypi-dev

For example, again on Raspbian:

./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/
make
sudo make install

Then, you can try out the camera with a pipeline line:
gst-launch-1.0 rpicamsrc bitrate=1000000 ! filesink location=test.h264
should produce a file called test.h264, while showing a preview window
on the screen.

gst-inspect-1.0 rpicamsrc to get an idea of the properties that have been
implemented.

See the REQUIREMENTS file for the full list of build requirements.
